# grub-theme-distro-massos
MassOS variant of distro-grub-themes.

This is a custom variant of the [distro-grub-themes](https://github.com/AdisonCavani/distro-grub-themes) project, for the MassOS operating system.

Each "distro" has its own theme in this project, but they all follow a common style. The MassOS variant aims to replicate this as closely as possible, but also incorporates a few fixes/extras, including the following:

- Added the distro logo for MassOS, so MassOS menu entries in the bootloader will have the correct logo.
- Rendered the background in 4K (3840x2160) instead of the default 1080p, to improve fidelity on higher resolution screens.

[distro-grub-themes](https://github.com/AdisonCavani/distro-grub-themes) was created by [AdisonCavani](https://github.com/AdisonCavani), and is licensed under the [GNU GPLv3](https://github.com/AdisonCavani/distro-grub-themes/blob/master/LICENSE).

The MassOS variant of distro-grub-themes was created by the MassOS developers, and is licensed under the same license as the upstream project (the license text is copied verbatim in the LICENSE file).

Do note that, for technical reasons, we were required to re-create the background image from scratch instead of altering one of the existing/upstream images. As such, we have tried to stay as close to the original design as possible (except, obviously, the MassOS banner/customization), but subtle differences may be noticable in side-by-side comparisons. Although we do not consider this to be an issue, we understand that it may make it awkward for the MassOS variant to be incorporated back into the upstream project, if that is desired by the upstream project author(s).
